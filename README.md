# How-to

Requirements:

-   Python from python.org *or* onlinegdb.com on browser

## Using IDLE

1.  Download and install Python from python.org and select the latest version (I'm running my Python using 3.9.X)
2.  **CHECK** the install with *PATH* because it'll use some important things
3.  Install it or you can customise it
4.  Wait until done
5.  Open your IDLE by searching it through Windows Search
6.  Copy-paste the content inside **.py** file to Python IDLE and save it
7.  Run it by pressing *F5*
